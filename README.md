# Iterative solution of evolutionary PDEs via all-at-once methods

Submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford.

--------------------------

This repository accompanies my dissertation "Iterative solution of evolutionary PDEs via all-at-once methods" with Prof Andrew Wathen. It contains pminres.m and fftsolve.m—two components of the solver—and numerical simulations for the heat equation. Use plot_settings.m for nice plotting outputs.
